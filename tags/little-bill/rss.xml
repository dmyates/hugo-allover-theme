      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again and looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; Alice heard it muttering to itself, &amp;ldquo;The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh, my dear paws! Oh, my fur and whiskers! She&amp;rsquo;ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets! Where &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; I have dropped them, I wonder?&amp;rdquo; Alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid-gloves and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were nowhere to be seen&amp;ndash;everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the little door, had vanished completely.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
