Later, she went through the looking-glass and found something there.\n","permalink":"https://dmyates.github.io/hugo-all-over-theme/alice/","tags":null,"title":"Alice in Wonderland"},{"categories":null,"contents":"One thing was certain, that the white kitten had had nothing to do with it:—it was the black kitten’s fault entirely. For the white kitten had been having its face washed by the old cat for the last quarter of an hour (and bearing it pretty well, considering); so you see that it couldn’t have had any hand in the mischief.\nThe way Dinah washed her children’s faces was this: first she held the poor thing down by its ear with one paw, and then with the other paw she rubbed its face all over, the wrong way, beginning at the nose: and just now, as I said, she was hard at work on the white kitten, which was lying quite still and trying to purr—no doubt feeling that it was all meant for its good.\nBut the black kitten had been finished with earlier in the afternoon, and so, while Alice was sitting curled up in a corner of the great arm-chair, half talking to herself and half asleep, the kitten had been having a grand game of romps with the ball of worsted Alice had been trying to wind up, and had been rolling it up and down till it had all come undone again; and there it was, spread over the hearth-rug, all knots and tangles, with the kitten running after its own tail in the middle.\n‘Oh, you wicked little thing!’ cried Alice, catching up the kitten, and giving it a little kiss to make it understand that it was in disgrace. ‘Really, Dinah ought to have taught you better manners! You ought, Dinah, you know you ought!’ she added, looking reproachfully at the old cat, and speaking in as cross a voice as she could manage—and then she scrambled back into the arm-chair, taking the kitten and the worsted with her, and began winding up the ball again. But she didn’t get on very fast, as she was talking all the time, sometimes to the kitten, and sometimes to herself. Kitty sat very demurely on her knee, pretending to watch the progress of the winding, and now and then putting out one paw and gently touching the ball, as if it would be glad to help, if it might.\n‘Do you know what to-morrow is, Kitty?’ Alice began. ‘You’d have guessed if you’d been up in the window with me—only Dinah was making you tidy, so you couldn’t. I was watching the boys getting in sticks for the bonfire—and it wants plenty of sticks, Kitty! Only it got so cold, and it snowed so, they had to leave off. Never mind, Kitty, we’ll go and see the bonfire to-morrow.’ Here Alice wound two or three turns of the worsted round the kitten’s neck, just to see how it would look: this led to a scramble, in which the ball rolled down upon the floor, and yards and yards of it got unwound again.\n‘Do you know, I was so angry, Kitty,’ Alice went on as soon as they were comfortably settled again, ‘when I saw all the mischief you had been doing, I was very nearly opening the window, and putting you out into the snow! And you’d have deserved it, you little mischievous darling! What have you got to say for yourself? Now don’t interrupt me!’ she went on, holding up one finger. ‘I’m going to tell you all your faults. Number one: you squeaked twice while Dinah was washing your face this morning. Now you can’t deny it, Kitty: I heard you! What’s that you say?’ (pretending that the kitten was speaking.) ‘Her paw went into your eye? Well, that’s your fault, for keeping your eyes open—if you’d shut them tight up, it wouldn’t have happened. Now don’t make any more excuses, but listen! Number two: you pulled Snowdrop away by the tail just as I had put down the saucer of milk before her! What, you were thirsty, were you? How do you know she wasn’t thirsty too? Now for number three: you unwound every bit of the worsted while I wasn’t looking!\n‘That’s three faults, Kitty, and you’ve not been punished for any of them yet. You know I’m saving up all your punishments for Wednesday week—Suppose they had saved up all my punishments!’ she went on, talking more to herself than the kitten. ‘What would they do at the end of a year? I should be sent to prison, I suppose, when the day came. Or—let me see—suppose each punishment was to be going without a dinner: then, when the miserable day came, I should have to go without fifty dinners at once! Well, I shouldn’t mind that much! I’d far rather go without them than eat them!\n‘Do you hear the snow against the window-panes, Kitty? How nice and soft it sounds! Just as if some one was kissing the window all over outside. I wonder if the snow loves the trees and fields, that it kisses them so gently? And then it covers them up snug, you know, with a white quilt; and perhaps it says, “Go to sleep, darlings, till the summer comes again.” And when they wake up in the summer, Kitty, they dress themselves all in green, and dance about—whenever the wind blows—oh, that’s very pretty!’ cried Alice, dropping the ball of worsted to clap her hands. ‘And I do so wish it was true! I’m sure the woods look sleepy in the autumn, when the leaves are getting brown.\n‘Kitty, can you play chess? Now, don’t smile, my dear, I’m asking it seriously. Because, when we were playing just now, you watched just as if you understood it: and when I said “Check!” you purred! Well, it was a nice check, Kitty, and really I might have won, if it hadn’t been for that nasty Knight, that came wiggling down among my pieces. Kitty, dear, let’s pretend—’ And here I wish I could tell you half the things Alice used to say, beginning with her favourite phrase ‘Let’s pretend.’ She had had quite a long argument with her sister only the day before—all because Alice had begun with ‘Let’s pretend we’re kings and queens;’ and her sister, who liked being very exact, had argued that they couldn’t, because there were only two of them, and Alice had been reduced at last to say, ‘Well, you can be one of them then, and I’ll be all the rest.’ And once she had really frightened her old nurse by shouting suddenly in her ear, ‘Nurse! Do let’s pretend that I’m a hungry hyaena, and you’re a bone.’\nBut this is taking us away from Alice’s speech to the kitten. ‘Let’s pretend that you’re the Red Queen, Kitty! Do you know, I think if you sat up and folded your arms, you’d look exactly like her. Now do try, there’s a dear!’ And Alice got the Red Queen off the table, and set it up before the kitten as a model for it to imitate: however, the thing didn’t succeed, principally, Alice said, because the kitten wouldn’t fold its arms properly. So, to punish it, she held it up to the Looking-glass, that it might see how sulky it was—‘and if you’re not good directly,’ she added, ‘I’ll put you through into Looking-glass House. How would you like that?’\n‘Now, if you’ll only attend, Kitty, and not talk so much, I’ll tell you all my ideas about Looking-glass House. First, there’s the room you can see through the glass—that’s just the same as our drawing room, only the things go the other way. I can see all of it when I get upon a chair—all but the bit behind the fireplace. Oh! I do so wish I could see that bit! I want so much to know whether they’ve a fire in the winter: you never can tell, you know, unless our fire smokes, and then smoke comes up in that room too—but that may be only pretence, just to make it look as if they had a fire. Well then, the books are something like our books, only the words go the wrong way; I know that, because I’ve held up one of our books to the glass, and then they hold up one in the other room.\n‘How would you like to live in Looking-glass House, Kitty? I wonder if they’d give you milk in there? Perhaps Looking-glass milk isn’t good to drink—But oh, Kitty! now we come to the passage. You can just see a little peep of the passage in Looking-glass House, if you leave the door of our drawing-room wide open: and it’s very like our passage as far as you can see, only you know it may be quite different on beyond. Oh, Kitty! how nice it would be if we could only get through into Looking-glass House! I’m sure it’s got, oh! such beautiful things in it! Let’s pretend there’s a way of getting through into it, somehow, Kitty. Let’s pretend the glass has got all soft like gauze, so that we can get through. Why, it’s turning into a sort of mist now, I declare! It’ll be easy enough to get through—’ She was up on the chimney-piece while she said this, though she hardly knew how she had got there. And certainly the glass was beginning to melt away, just like a bright silvery mist.\nIn another moment Alice was through the glass, and had jumped lightly down into the Looking-glass room. The very first thing she did was to look whether there was a fire in the fireplace, and she was quite pleased to find that there was a real one, blazing away as brightly as the one she had left behind. ‘So I shall be as warm here as I was in the old room,’ thought Alice: ‘warmer, in fact, because there’ll be no one here to scold me away from the fire. Oh, what fun it’ll be, when they see me through the glass in here, and can’t get at me!’\nThen she began looking about, and noticed that what could be seen from the old room was quite common and uninteresting, but that all the rest was as different as possible. For instance, the pictures on the wall next the fire seemed to be all alive, and the very clock on the chimney-piece (you know you can only see the back of it in the Looking-glass) had got the face of a little old man, and grinned at her.\n‘They don’t keep this room so tidy as the other,’ Alice thought to herself, as she noticed several of the chessmen down in the hearth among the cinders: but in another moment, with a little ‘Oh!’ of surprise, she was down on her hands and knees watching them. The chessmen were walking about, two and two!\n‘Here are the Red King and the Red Queen,’ Alice said (in a whisper, for fear of frightening them), ‘and there are the White King and the White Queen sitting on the edge of the shovel—and here are two castles walking arm in arm—I don’t think they can hear me,’ she went on, as she put her head closer down, ‘and I’m nearly sure they can’t see me. I feel somehow as if I were invisible—’\nHere something began squeaking on the table behind Alice, and made her turn her head just in time to see one of the White Pawns roll over and begin kicking: she watched it with great curiosity to see what would happen next.\n‘It is the voice of my child!’ the White Queen cried out as she rushed past the King, so violently that she knocked him over among the cinders. ‘My precious Lily! My imperial kitten!’ and she began scrambling wildly up the side of the fender.\n‘Imperial fiddlestick!’ said the King, rubbing his nose, which had been hurt by the fall. He had a right to be a little annoyed with the Queen, for he was covered with ashes from head to foot.\nAlice was very anxious to be of use, and, as the poor little Lily was nearly screaming herself into a fit, she hastily picked up the Queen and set her on the table by the side of her noisy little daughter.\nThe Queen gasped, and sat down: the rapid journey through the air had quite taken away her breath and for a minute or two she could do nothing but hug the little Lily in silence. As soon as she had recovered her breath a little, she called out to the White King, who was sitting sulkily among the ashes, ‘Mind the volcano!’\n‘What volcano?’ said the King, looking up anxiously into the fire, as if he thought that was the most likely place to find one.\n‘Blew—me—up,’ panted the Queen, who was still a little out of breath. ‘Mind you come up—the regular way—don’t get blown up!’\nAlice watched the White King as he slowly struggled up from bar to bar, till at last she said, ‘Why, you’ll be hours and hours getting to the table, at that rate. I’d far better help you, hadn’t I?’ But the King took no notice of the question: it was quite clear that he could neither hear her nor see her.\nSo Alice picked him up very gently, and lifted him across more slowly than she had lifted the Queen, that she mightn’t take his breath away: but, before she put him on the table, she thought she might as well dust him a little, he was so covered with ashes.\nShe said afterwards that she had never seen in all her life such a face as the King made, when he found himself held in the air by an invisible hand, and being dusted: he was far too much astonished to cry out, but his eyes and his mouth went on getting larger and larger, and rounder and rounder, till her hand shook so with laughing that she nearly let him drop upon the floor.\n‘Oh! please don’t make such faces, my dear!’ she cried out, quite forgetting that the King couldn’t hear her. ‘You make me laugh so that I can hardly hold you! And don’t keep your mouth so wide open! All the ashes will get into it—there, now I think you’re tidy enough!’ she added, as she smoothed his hair, and set him upon the table near the Queen.\nThe King immediately fell flat on his back, and lay perfectly still: and Alice was a little alarmed at what she had done, and went round the room to see if she could find any water to throw over him. However, she could find nothing but a bottle of ink, and when she got back with it she found he had recovered, and he and the Queen were talking together in a frightened whisper—so low, that Alice could hardly hear what they said.\nThe King was saying, ‘I assure, you my dear, I turned cold to the very ends of my whiskers!’\nTo which the Queen replied, ‘You haven’t got any whiskers.’\n‘The horror of that moment,’ the King went on, ‘I shall never, never forget!’\n‘You will, though,’ the Queen said, ‘if you don’t make a memorandum of it.’\nAlice looked on with great interest as the King took an enormous memorandum-book out of his pocket, and began writing. A sudden thought struck her, and she took hold of the end of the pencil, which came some way over his shoulder, and began writing for him.\nThe poor King looked puzzled and unhappy, and struggled with the pencil for some time without saying anything; but Alice was too strong for him, and at last he panted out, ‘My dear! I really must get a thinner pencil. I can’t manage this one a bit; it writes all manner of things that I don’t intend—’\n‘What manner of things?’ said the Queen, looking over the book (in which Alice had put ‘The White Knight is sliding down the poker. He balances very badly’) ‘That’s not a memorandum of your feelings!’\nThere was a book lying near Alice on the table, and while she sat watching the White King (for she was still a little anxious about him, and had the ink all ready to throw over him, in case he fainted again), she turned over the leaves, to find some part that she could read, ‘—for it’s all in some language I don’t know,’ she said to herself.\nIt was like this.\n YKCOWREBBAJ sevot yhtils eht dna,gillirb sawT’ ebaw eht ni elbmig dna eryg diD ,sevogorob eht erew ysmim llA .ebargtuo shtar emom eht dnA  She puzzled over this for some time, but at last a bright thought struck her. ‘Why, it’s a Looking-glass book, of course! And if I hold it up to a glass, the words will all go the right way again.’\nThis was the poem that Alice read.\n JABBERWOCKY ‘Twas brillig, and the slithy toves Did gyre and gimble in the wabe; All mimsy were the borogoves, And the mome raths outgrabe. ‘Beware the Jabberwock, my son! The jaws that bite, the claws that catch! Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun The frumious Bandersnatch!’ He took his vorpal sword in hand: Long time the manxome foe he sought— So rested he by the Tumtum tree, And stood awhile in thought. And as in uffish thought he stood, The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame, Came whiffling through the tulgey wood, And burbled as it came! One, two! One, two! And through and through The vorpal blade went snicker-snack! He left it dead, and with its head He went galumphing back. ‘And hast thou slain the Jabberwock? Come to my arms, my beamish boy! O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!’ He chortled in his joy. ‘Twas brillig, and the slithy toves Did gyre and gimble in the wabe; All mimsy were the borogoves, And the mome raths outgrabe.  ‘It seems very pretty,’ she said when she had finished it, ‘but it’s rather hard to understand!’ (You see she didn’t like to confess, ever to herself, that she couldn’t make it out at all.) ‘Somehow it seems to fill my head with ideas—only I don’t exactly know what they are! However, somebody killed something: that’s clear, at any rate—’\n‘But oh!’ thought Alice, suddenly jumping up, ‘if I don’t make haste I shall have to go back through the Looking-glass, before I’ve seen what the rest of the house is like! Let’s have a look at the garden first!’ She was out of the room in a moment, and ran down stairs—or, at least, it wasn’t exactly running, but a new invention of hers for getting down stairs quickly and easily, as Alice said to herself. She just kept the tips of her fingers on the hand-rail, and floated gently down without even touching the stairs with her feet; then she floated on through the hall, and would have gone straight out at the door in the same way, if she hadn’t caught hold of the door-post. She was getting a little giddy with so much floating in the air, and was rather glad to find herself walking again in the natural way.\n","permalink":"https://dmyates.github.io/hugo-all-over-theme/looking/","tags":null,"title":"Looking-Glass House"},{"categories":null,"contents":"‘I should see the garden far better,’ said Alice to herself, ‘if I could get to the top of that hill: and here’s a path that leads straight to it—at least, no, it doesn’t do that—’ (after going a few yards along the path, and turning several sharp corners), ‘but I suppose it will at last. But how curiously it twists! It’s more like a corkscrew than a path! Well, this turn goes to the hill, I suppose—no, it doesn’t! This goes straight back to the house! Well then, I’ll try it the other way.’\nAnd so she did: wandering up and down, and trying turn after turn, but always coming back to the house, do what she would. Indeed, once, when she turned a corner rather more quickly than usual, she ran against it before she could stop herself.\n‘It’s no use talking about it,’ Alice said, looking up at the house and pretending it was arguing with her. ‘I’m not going in again yet. I know I should have to get through the Looking-glass again—back into the old room—and there’d be an end of all my adventures!’\nSo, resolutely turning her back upon the house, she set out once more down the path, determined to keep straight on till she got to the hill. For a few minutes all went on well, and she was just saying, ‘I really shall do it this time—’ when the path gave a sudden twist and shook itself (as she described it afterwards), and the next moment she found herself actually walking in at the door.\n‘Oh, it’s too bad!’ she cried. ‘I never saw such a house for getting in the way! Never!’\nHowever, there was the hill full in sight, so there was nothing to be done but start again. This time she came upon a large flower-bed, with a border of daisies, and a willow-tree growing in the middle.\n‘O Tiger-lily,’ said Alice, addressing herself to one that was waving gracefully about in the wind, ‘I wish you could talk!’\n‘We can talk,’ said the Tiger-lily: ‘when there’s anybody worth talking to.’\nAlice was so astonished that she could not speak for a minute: it quite seemed to take her breath away. At length, as the Tiger-lily only went on waving about, she spoke again, in a timid voice—almost in a whisper. ‘And can all the flowers talk?’\n‘As well as you can,’ said the Tiger-lily. ‘And a great deal louder.’\n‘It isn’t manners for us to begin, you know,’ said the Rose, ‘and I really was wondering when you’d speak! Said I to myself, “Her face has got some sense in it, though it’s not a clever one!” Still, you’re the right colour, and that goes a long way.’\n‘I don’t care about the colour,’ the Tiger-lily remarked. ‘If only her petals curled up a little more, she’d be all right.’\nAlice didn’t like being criticised, so she began asking questions. ‘Aren’t you sometimes frightened at being planted out here, with nobody to take care of you?’\n‘There’s the tree in the middle,’ said the Rose: ‘what else is it good for?’\n‘But what could it do, if any danger came?’ Alice asked.\n‘It says “Bough-wough!”’ cried a Daisy: ‘that’s why its branches are called boughs!’\n‘Didn’t you know that?’ cried another Daisy, and here they all began shouting together, till the air seemed quite full of little shrill voices. ‘Silence, every one of you!’ cried the Tiger-lily, waving itself passionately from side to side, and trembling with excitement. ‘They know I can’t get at them!’ it panted, bending its quivering head towards Alice, ‘or they wouldn’t dare to do it!’\n‘Never mind!’ Alice said in a soothing tone, and stooping down to the daisies, who were just beginning again, she whispered, ‘If you don’t hold your tongues, I’ll pick you!’\nThere was silence in a moment, and several of the pink daisies turned white.\n‘That’s right!’ said the Tiger-lily. ‘The daisies are worst of all. When one speaks, they all begin together, and it’s enough to make one wither to hear the way they go on!’\n‘How is it you can all talk so nicely?’ Alice said, hoping to get it into a better temper by a compliment. ‘I’ve been in many gardens before, but none of the flowers could talk.’\n‘Put your hand down, and feel the ground,’ said the Tiger-lily. ‘Then you’ll know why.’\nAlice did so. ‘It’s very hard,’ she said, ‘but I don’t see what that has to do with it.’\n‘In most gardens,’ the Tiger-lily said, ‘they make the beds too soft—so that the flowers are always asleep.’\nThis sounded a very good reason, and Alice was quite pleased to know it. ‘I never thought of that before!’ she said.\n‘It’s my opinion that you never think at all,’ the Rose said in a rather severe tone.\n‘I never saw anybody that looked stupider,’ a Violet said, so suddenly, that Alice quite jumped; for it hadn’t spoken before.\n‘Hold your tongue!’ cried the Tiger-lily. ‘As if you ever saw anybody! You keep your head under the leaves, and snore away there, till you know no more what’s going on in the world, than if you were a bud!’\n‘Are there any more people in the garden besides me?’ Alice said, not choosing to notice the Rose’s last remark.\n‘There’s one other flower in the garden that can move about like you,’ said the Rose. ‘I wonder how you do it—’ (‘You’re always wondering,’ said the Tiger-lily), ‘but she’s more bushy than you are.’\n‘Is she like me?’ Alice asked eagerly, for the thought crossed her mind, ‘There’s another little girl in the garden, somewhere!’\n‘Well, she has the same awkward shape as you,’ the Rose said, ‘but she’s redder—and her petals are shorter, I think.’\n‘Her petals are done up close, almost like a dahlia,’ the Tiger-lily interrupted: ‘not tumbled about anyhow, like yours.’\n‘But that’s not your fault,’ the Rose added kindly: ‘you’re beginning to fade, you know—and then one can’t help one’s petals getting a little untidy.’\nAlice didn’t like this idea at all: so, to change the subject, she asked ‘Does she ever come out here?’\n‘I daresay you’ll see her soon,’ said the Rose. ‘She’s one of the thorny kind.’\n‘Where does she wear the thorns?’ Alice asked with some curiosity.\n‘Why all round her head, of course,’ the Rose replied. ‘I was wondering you hadn’t got some too. I thought it was the regular rule.’\n‘She’s coming!’ cried the Larkspur. ‘I hear her footstep, thump, thump, thump, along the gravel-walk!’\nAlice looked round eagerly, and found that it was the Red Queen. ‘She’s grown a good deal!’ was her first remark. She had indeed: when Alice first found her in the ashes, she had been only three inches high—and here she was, half a head taller than Alice herself!\n‘It’s the fresh air that does it,’ said the Rose: ‘wonderfully fine air it is, out here.’\n‘I think I’ll go and meet her,’ said Alice, for, though the flowers were interesting enough, she felt that it would be far grander to have a talk with a real Queen.\n‘You can’t possibly do that,’ said the Rose: ‘I should advise you to walk the other way.’\nThis sounded nonsense to Alice, so she said nothing, but set off at once towards the Red Queen. To her surprise, she lost sight of her in a moment, and found herself walking in at the front-door again.\nA little provoked, she drew back, and after looking everywhere for the queen (whom she spied out at last, a long way off), she thought she would try the plan, this time, of walking in the opposite direction.\nIt succeeded beautifully. She had not been walking a minute before she found herself face to face with the Red Queen, and full in sight of the hill she had been so long aiming at.\n‘Where do you come from?’ said the Red Queen. ‘And where are you going? Look up, speak nicely, and don’t twiddle your fingers all the time.’\nAlice attended to all these directions, and explained, as well as she could, that she had lost her way.\n‘I don’t know what you mean by your way,’ said the Queen: ‘all the ways about here belong to me—but why did you come out here at all?’ she added in a kinder tone. ‘Curtsey while you’re thinking what to say, it saves time.’\nAlice wondered a little at this, but she was too much in awe of the Queen to disbelieve it. ‘I’ll try it when I go home,’ she thought to herself, ‘the next time I’m a little late for dinner.’\n‘It’s time for you to answer now,’ the Queen said, looking at her watch: ‘open your mouth a little wider when you speak, and always say “your Majesty.”’\n‘I only wanted to see what the garden was like, your Majesty—’\n‘That’s right,’ said the Queen, patting her on the head, which Alice didn’t like at all, ‘though, when you say “garden,”—I’ve seen gardens, compared with which this would be a wilderness.’\nAlice didn’t dare to argue the point, but went on: ‘—and I thought I’d try and find my way to the top of that hill—’\n‘When you say “hill,”’ the Queen interrupted, ‘I could show you hills, in comparison with which you’d call that a valley.’\n‘No, I shouldn’t,’ said Alice, surprised into contradicting her at last: ‘a hill can’t be a valley, you know. That would be nonsense—’\nThe Red Queen shook her head, ‘You may call it “nonsense” if you like,’ she said, ‘but I’ve heard nonsense, compared with which that would be as sensible as a dictionary!’\nAlice curtseyed again, as she was afraid from the Queen’s tone that she was a little offended: and they walked on in silence till they got to the top of the little hill.\nFor some minutes Alice stood without speaking, looking out in all directions over the country—and a most curious country it was. There were a number of tiny little brooks running straight across it from side to side, and the ground between was divided up into squares by a number of little green hedges, that reached from brook to brook.\n‘I declare it’s marked out just like a large chessboard!’ Alice said at last. ‘There ought to be some men moving about somewhere—and so there are!’ She added in a tone of delight, and her heart began to beat quick with excitement as she went on. ‘It’s a great huge game of chess that’s being played—all over the world—if this is the world at all, you know. Oh, what fun it is! How I wish I was one of them! I wouldn’t mind being a Pawn, if only I might join—though of course I should like to be a Queen, best.’\nShe glanced rather shyly at the real Queen as she said this, but her companion only smiled pleasantly, and said, ‘That’s easily managed. You can be the White Queen’s Pawn, if you like, as Lily’s too young to play; and you’re in the Second Square to begin with: when you get to the Eighth Square you’ll be a Queen—’ Just at this moment, somehow or other, they began to run.\nAlice never could quite make out, in thinking it over afterwards, how it was that they began: all she remembers is, that they were running hand in hand, and the Queen went so fast that it was all she could do to keep up with her: and still the Queen kept crying ‘Faster! Faster!’ but Alice felt she could not go faster, though she had not breath left to say so.\nThe most curious part of the thing was, that the trees and the other things round them never changed their places at all: however fast they went, they never seemed to pass anything. ‘I wonder if all the things move along with us?’ thought poor puzzled Alice. And the Queen seemed to guess her thoughts, for she cried, ‘Faster! Don’t try to talk!’\nNot that Alice had any idea of doing that. She felt as if she would never be able to talk again, she was getting so much out of breath: and still the Queen cried ‘Faster! Faster!’ and dragged her along. ‘Are we nearly there?’ Alice managed to pant out at last.\n‘Nearly there!’ the Queen repeated. ‘Why, we passed it ten minutes ago! Faster!’ And they ran on for a time in silence, with the wind whistling in Alice’s ears, and almost blowing her hair off her head, she fancied.\n‘Now! Now!’ cried the Queen. ‘Faster! Faster!’ And they went so fast that at last they seemed to skim through the air, hardly touching the ground with their feet, till suddenly, just as Alice was getting quite exhausted, they stopped, and she found herself sitting on the ground, breathless and giddy.\nThe Queen propped her up against a tree, and said kindly, ‘You may rest a little now.’\nAlice looked round her in great surprise. ‘Why, I do believe we’ve been under this tree the whole time! Everything’s just as it was!’\n‘Of course it is,’ said the Queen, ‘what would you have it?’\n‘Well, in our country,’ said Alice, still panting a little, ‘you’d generally get to somewhere else—if you ran very fast for a long time, as we’ve been doing.’\n‘A slow sort of country!’ said the Queen. ‘Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place. If you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that!’\n‘I’d rather not try, please!’ said Alice. ‘I’m quite content to stay here—only I am so hot and thirsty!’\n‘I know what you’d like!’ the Queen said good-naturedly, taking a little box out of her pocket. ‘Have a biscuit?’\nAlice thought it would not be civil to say ‘No,’ though it wasn’t at all what she wanted. So she took it, and ate it as well as she could: and it was very dry; and she thought she had never been so nearly choked in all her life.\n‘While you’re refreshing yourself,’ said the Queen, ‘I’ll just take the measurements.’ And she took a ribbon out of her pocket, marked in inches, and began measuring the ground, and sticking little pegs in here and there.\n‘At the end of two yards,’ she said, putting in a peg to mark the distance, ‘I shall give you your directions—have another biscuit?’\n‘No, thank you,’ said Alice: ‘one’s quite enough!’\n‘Thirst quenched, I hope?’ said the Queen.\nAlice did not know what to say to this, but luckily the Queen did not wait for an answer, but went on. ‘At the end of three yards I shall repeat them—for fear of your forgetting them. At the end of four, I shall say good-bye. And at the end of five, I shall go!’\nShe had got all the pegs put in by this time, and Alice looked on with great interest as she returned to the tree, and then began slowly walking down the row.\nAt the two-yard peg she faced round, and said, ‘A pawn goes two squares in its first move, you know. So you’ll go very quickly through the Third Square—by railway, I should think—and you’ll find yourself in the Fourth Square in no time. Well, that square belongs to Tweedledum and Tweedledee—the Fifth is mostly water—the Sixth belongs to Humpty Dumpty—But you make no remark?’\n‘I—I didn’t know I had to make one—just then,’ Alice faltered out.\n‘You should have said, “It’s extremely kind of you to tell me all this”—however, we’ll suppose it said—the Seventh Square is all forest—however, one of the Knights will show you the way—and in the Eighth Square we shall be Queens together, and it’s all feasting and fun!’ Alice got up and curtseyed, and sat down again.\nAt the next peg the Queen turned again, and this time she said, ‘Speak in French when you can’t think of the English for a thing—turn out your toes as you walk—and remember who you are!’ She did not wait for Alice to curtsey this time, but walked on quickly to the next peg, where she turned for a moment to say ‘good-bye,’ and then hurried on to the last.\nHow it happened, Alice never knew, but exactly as she came to the last peg, she was gone. Whether she vanished into the air, or whether she ran quickly into the wood (‘and she can run very fast!’ thought Alice), there was no way of guessing, but she was gone, and Alice began to remember that she was a Pawn, and that it would soon be time for her to move.\n","permalink":"https://dmyates.github.io/hugo-all-over-theme/glass/","tags":null,"title":"The Garden of Live Flowers"},{"categories":null,"contents":" Allover comes with a couple of shortcodes that I find quite useful, and perhaps you will too.\nCaptions Markdown-capable image captions, for if you don\u0026rsquo;t want to use {{\u0026lt; figure \u0026gt;}}:\nThis is a caption.

The Duchess! Oh, my dear paws! Oh, my fur and whiskers! She\u0026rsquo;ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets! Where can I have dropped them, I wonder?\u0026rdquo; Alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid-gloves and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were nowhere to be seen\u0026ndash;everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the little door, had vanished completely.\nVery soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, and called to her, in an angry tone, \u0026ldquo;Why, Mary Ann, what are you doing out here? Run home this moment and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan! Quick, now!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;He took me for his housemaid!\u0026rdquo; said Alice, as she ran off. \u0026ldquo;How surprised he\u0026rsquo;ll be when he finds out who I am!\u0026rdquo; As she said this, she came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name \u0026ldquo;W. RABBIT\u0026rdquo; engraved upon it. She went in without knocking and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves.\nBy this time, Alice had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window, and on it a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid-gloves; she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves and was just going to leave the room, when her eyes fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-glass. She uncorked it and put it to her lips, saying to herself, \u0026ldquo;I do hope it\u0026rsquo;ll make me grow large again, for, really, I\u0026rsquo;m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!\u0026rdquo;\nBefore she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put down the bottle, remarking, \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s quite enough\u0026ndash;I hope I sha\u0026rsquo;n\u0026rsquo;t grow any more.\u0026rdquo;\nAlas! It was too late to wish that! She went on growing and growing and very soon she had to kneel down on the floor. Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out of the window and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself, \u0026ldquo;Now I can do no more, whatever happens. What will become of me?\u0026rdquo;\nLuckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect and she grew no larger. After a few minutes she heard a voice outside and stopped to listen.\n\u0026ldquo;Mary Ann! Mary Ann!\u0026rdquo; said the voice. \u0026ldquo;Fetch me my gloves this moment!\u0026rdquo; Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her and she trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit and had no reason to be afraid of it.\nPresently the Rabbit came up to the door and tried to open it; but as the door opened inwards and Alice\u0026rsquo;s elbow was pressed hard against it, that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself, \u0026ldquo;Then I\u0026rsquo;ll go \u0026lsquo;round and get in at the window.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That you won\u0026rsquo;t!\u0026rdquo; thought Alice; and after waiting till she fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her hand and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall and a crash of broken glass, from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame or something of that sort.\nNext came an angry voice\u0026ndash;the Rabbit\u0026rsquo;s\u0026ndash;\u0026ldquo;Pat! Pat! Where are you?\u0026rdquo; And then a voice she had never heard before, \u0026ldquo;Sure then, I\u0026rsquo;m here! Digging for apples, yer honor!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Here! Come and help me out of this! Now tell me, Pat, what\u0026rsquo;s that in the window?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Sure, it\u0026rsquo;s an arm, yer honor!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, it\u0026rsquo;s got no business there, at any rate; go and take it away!\u0026rdquo;\nThere was a long silence after this and Alice could only hear whispers now and then, and at last she spread out her hand again and made another snatch in the air. This time there were two little shrieks and more sounds of broken glass. \u0026ldquo;I wonder what they\u0026rsquo;ll do next!\u0026rdquo; thought Alice. \u0026ldquo;As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they could!\u0026rdquo;\nShe waited for some time without hearing anything more. At last came a rumbling of little cart-wheels and the sound of a good many voices all talking together. She made out the words: \u0026ldquo;Where\u0026rsquo;s the other ladder? Bill\u0026rsquo;s got the other\u0026ndash;Bill! Here, Bill! Will the roof bear?\u0026ndash;Who\u0026rsquo;s to go down the chimney?\u0026ndash;Nay, I sha\u0026rsquo;n\u0026rsquo;t! You do it! Here, Bill! The master says you\u0026rsquo;ve got to go down the chimney!\u0026rdquo;\nAlice drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could and waited till she heard a little animal scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her; then she gave one sharp kick and waited to see what would happen next.\nThe first thing she heard was a general chorus of \u0026ldquo;There goes Bill!\u0026rdquo; then the Rabbit\u0026rsquo;s voice alone\u0026ndash;\u0026ldquo;Catch him, you by the hedge!\u0026rdquo; Then silence and then another confusion of voices\u0026ndash;\u0026ldquo;Hold up his head\u0026ndash;Brandy now\u0026ndash;Don\u0026rsquo;t choke him\u0026ndash;What happened to you?\u0026rdquo;\nLast came a little feeble, squeaking voice, \u0026ldquo;Well, I hardly know\u0026ndash;No more, thank ye. I\u0026rsquo;m better now\u0026ndash;all I know is, something comes at me like a Jack-in-the-box and up I goes like a sky-rocket!\u0026rdquo;\nAfter a minute or two of silence, they began moving about again, and Alice heard the Rabbit say, \u0026ldquo;A barrowful will do, to begin with.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;A barrowful of what?\u0026rdquo; thought Alice. But she had not long to doubt, for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window and some of them hit her in the face. Alice noticed, with some surprise, that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor and a bright idea came into her head. \u0026ldquo;If I eat one of these cakes,\u0026rdquo; she thought, \u0026ldquo;it\u0026rsquo;s sure to make some change in my size.\u0026rdquo;\nSo she swallowed one of the cakes and was delighted to find that she began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get through the door, she ran out of the house and found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she appeared, but she ran off as hard as she could and soon found herself safe in a thick wood.\nThe Duchess tucked her arm affectionately into Alice\u0026rsquo;s.\n\u0026ldquo;The first thing I\u0026rsquo;ve got to do,\u0026rdquo; said Alice to herself, as she wandered about in the wood, \u0026ldquo;is to grow to my right size again; and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other, but the great question is \u0026lsquo;What?\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\nAlice looked all around her at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she could not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances. There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as herself. She stretched herself up on tiptoe and peeped over the edge and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue caterpillar, that was sitting on the top, with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long hookah and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else.\n","permalink":"https://dmyates.github.io/hugo-all-over-theme/1862/07/07/ch4-the-rabbit-sends-in-a-little-bill/","tags":["alice","white rabbit","little bill"],"title":"Chapter IV: The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill"},{"categories":null,"contents":"They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank\u0026ndash;the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross and uncomfortable.\nThe first question, of course, was how to get dry again. They had a consultation about this and after a few minutes, it seemed quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had known them all her life.\nAt last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of some authority among them, called out, \u0026ldquo;Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! I\u0026rsquo;ll soon make you dry enough!\u0026rdquo; They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the Mouse in the middle.\n\u0026ldquo;Ahem!\u0026rdquo; said the Mouse with an important air. \u0026ldquo;Are you all ready?

The question is, what did the archbishop find?\u0026rdquo;\nThe Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, \u0026ldquo;\u0026lsquo;\u0026ndash;found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the crown.\u0026rsquo;\u0026ndash;How are you getting on now, my dear?\u0026rdquo; it continued, turning to Alice as it spoke.\n\u0026ldquo;As wet as ever,\u0026rdquo; said Alice in a melancholy tone; \u0026ldquo;it doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to dry me at all.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;In that case,\u0026rdquo; said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, \u0026ldquo;I move that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies\u0026ndash;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Speak English!\u0026rdquo; said the Eaglet. \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know the meaning of half those long words, and, what\u0026rsquo;s more, I don\u0026rsquo;t believe you do either!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What I was going to say,\u0026rdquo; said the Dodo in an offended tone, \u0026ldquo;is that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What is a Caucus-race?\u0026rdquo; said Alice.\n\u0026ldquo;Why,\u0026rdquo; said the Dodo, \u0026ldquo;the best way to explain it is to do it.\u0026rdquo; First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, and then all the party were placed along the course, here and there. There was no \u0026ldquo;One, two, three and away!\u0026rdquo; but they began running when they liked and left off when they liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However, when they had been running half an hour or so and were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called out, \u0026ldquo;The race is over!\u0026rdquo; and they all crowded \u0026lsquo;round it, panting and asking, \u0026ldquo;But who has won?\u0026rdquo;\nThis question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought. At last it said, \u0026ldquo;Everybody has won, and all must have prizes.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But who is to give the prizes?\u0026rdquo; quite a chorus of voices asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Why, she, of course,\u0026rdquo; said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one finger; and the whole party at once crowded \u0026lsquo;round her, calling out, in a confused way, \u0026ldquo;Prizes! Prizes!\u0026rdquo;\nAlice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand into her pocket and pulled out a box of comfits (luckily the salt-water had not got into it) and handed them \u0026lsquo;round as prizes. There was exactly one a-piece, all \u0026lsquo;round.\nThe next thing was to eat the comfits; this caused some noise and confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back. However, it was over at last and they sat down again in a ring and begged the Mouse to tell them something more.\n\u0026ldquo;You promised to tell me your history, you know,\u0026rdquo; said Alice, \u0026ldquo;and why it is you hate\u0026ndash;C and D,\u0026rdquo; she added in a whisper, half afraid that it would be offended again.\n\u0026ldquo;Mine is a long and a sad tale!\u0026rdquo; said the Mouse, turning to Alice and sighing.\n\u0026ldquo;It is a long tail, certainly,\u0026rdquo; said Alice, looking down with wonder at the Mouse\u0026rsquo;s tail, \u0026ldquo;but why do you call it sad?\u0026rdquo; And she kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the tale was something like this:\u0026ndash;\n\u0026quot;Fury said to a mouse, That he met in the house, 'Let us both go to law: _I_ will prosecute _you_.-- Come, I'll take no denial: We must have the trial; For really this morning I've nothing to do.' Said the mouse to the cur, 'Such a trial, dear sir, With no jury or judge, would be wasting our breath.' 'I'll be judge, I'll be jury,' said cunning old Fury; 'I'll try the whole cause, and condemn you to death.'\u0026quot;  \u0026ldquo;You are not attending!\u0026rdquo; said the Mouse to Alice, severely. \u0026ldquo;What are you thinking of?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I beg your pardon,\u0026rdquo; said Alice very humbly, \u0026ldquo;you had got to the fifth bend, I think?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You insult me by talking such nonsense!\u0026rdquo; said the Mouse, getting up and walking away.\n\u0026ldquo;Please come back and finish your story!\u0026rdquo; Alice called after it. And the others all joined in chorus, \u0026ldquo;Yes, please do!\u0026rdquo; But the Mouse only shook its head impatiently and walked a little quicker.\n\u0026ldquo;I wish I had Dinah, our cat, here!\u0026rdquo; said Alice. This caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the birds hurried off at once, and a Canary called out in a trembling voice, to its children, \u0026ldquo;Come away, my dears! It\u0026rsquo;s high time you were all in bed!\u0026rdquo; On various pretexts they all moved off and Alice was soon left alone.\n\u0026ldquo;I wish I hadn\u0026rsquo;t mentioned Dinah! Nobody seems to like her down here and I\u0026rsquo;m sure she\u0026rsquo;s the best cat in the world!\u0026rdquo; Poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very lonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the distance and she looked up eagerly.\n","permalink":"https://dmyates.github.io/hugo-all-over-theme/1862/07/06/ch3-a-caucus-race-and-a-long-tale/","tags":["alice","long tail","long tale"],"title":"Chapter III: A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale"},{"categories":null,"contents":"\u0026ldquo;Curiouser and curiouser!\u0026rdquo; cried Alice (she was so much surprised that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English). \u0026ldquo;Now I\u0026rsquo;m opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-by, feet! Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you.\u0026rdquo;\nJust at this moment her head struck against the roof of the hall; in fact, she was now rather more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.\nPoor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more hopeless than ever. She sat down and began to cry again.\nShe went on shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool all \u0026lsquo;round her and reaching half down the hall.\nAfter a time, she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid-gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other. He came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to himself, \u0026ldquo;Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! won\u0026rsquo;t she be savage if I\u0026rsquo;ve kept her waiting!\u0026rdquo;\nWhen the Rabbit came near her, Alice began, in a low, timid voice, \u0026ldquo;If you please, sir\u0026ndash;\u0026rdquo; The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid-gloves and the fan and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.\nAlice took up the fan and gloves and she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking. \u0026ldquo;Dear, dear! How queer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual. Was I the same when I got up this morning? But if I\u0026rsquo;m not the same, the next question is, \u0026lsquo;Who in the world am I?\u0026rsquo; Ah, that\u0026rsquo;s the great puzzle!\u0026rdquo;\nAs she said this, she looked down at her hands and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit\u0026rsquo;s little white kid-gloves while she was talking. \u0026ldquo;How can I have done that?\u0026rdquo; she thought. \u0026ldquo;I must be growing small again.\u0026rdquo; She got up and went to the table to measure herself by it and found that she was now about two feet high and was going on shrinking rapidly. She soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding and she dropped it hastily, just in time to save herself from shrinking away altogether.\n\u0026ldquo;That was a narrow escape!\u0026rdquo; said Alice, a good deal frightened at the sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence. \u0026ldquo;And now for the garden!\u0026rdquo; And she ran with all speed back to the little door; but, alas! the little door was shut again and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before. \u0026ldquo;Things are worse than ever,\u0026rdquo; thought the poor child, \u0026ldquo;for I never was so small as this before, never!\u0026rdquo;\nAs she said these words, her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash! she was up to her chin in salt-water. Her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea. However, she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high.\nJust then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off, and she swam nearer to see what it was: she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.\n\u0026ldquo;Would it be of any use, now,\u0026rdquo; thought Alice, \u0026ldquo;to speak to this mouse? Everything is so out-of-the-way down here that I should think very likely it can talk; at any rate, there\u0026rsquo;s no harm in trying.\u0026rdquo; So she began, \u0026ldquo;O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!\u0026rdquo; The Mouse looked at her rather inquisitively and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes, but it said nothing.\n\u0026ldquo;Perhaps it doesn\u0026rsquo;t understand English,\u0026rdquo; thought Alice. \u0026ldquo;I dare say it\u0026rsquo;s a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.\u0026rdquo; So she began again: \u0026ldquo;Ou est ma chatte?\u0026rdquo; which was the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water and seemed to quiver all over with fright. \u0026ldquo;Oh, I beg your pardon!\u0026rdquo; cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the poor animal\u0026rsquo;s feelings. \u0026ldquo;I quite forgot you didn\u0026rsquo;t like cats.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Not like cats!\u0026rdquo; cried the Mouse in a shrill, passionate voice. \u0026ldquo;Would you like cats, if you were me?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, perhaps not,\u0026rdquo; said Alice in a soothing tone; \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t be angry about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah. I think you\u0026rsquo;d take a fancy to cats, if you could only see her. She is such a dear, quiet thing.\u0026rdquo; The Mouse was bristling all over and she felt certain it must be really offended. \u0026ldquo;We won\u0026rsquo;t talk about her any more, if you\u0026rsquo;d rather not.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We, indeed!\u0026rdquo; cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of its tail. \u0026ldquo;As if I would talk on such a subject! Our family always hated cats\u0026ndash;nasty, low, vulgar things! Don\u0026rsquo;t let me hear the name again!\u0026rdquo;\nAlice at the Mad Tea Party\n\u0026ldquo;I won\u0026rsquo;t indeed!\u0026rdquo; said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation. \u0026ldquo;Are you\u0026ndash;are you fond\u0026ndash;of\u0026ndash;of dogs? There is such a nice little dog near our house, I should like to show you! It kills all the rats and\u0026ndash;oh, dear!\u0026rdquo; cried Alice in a sorrowful tone. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m afraid I\u0026rsquo;ve offended it again!\u0026rdquo; For the Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went.\nSo she called softly after it, \u0026ldquo;Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we won\u0026rsquo;t talk about cats, or dogs either, if you don\u0026rsquo;t like them!\u0026rdquo; When the Mouse heard this, it turned \u0026lsquo;round and swam slowly back to her; its face was quite pale, and it said, in a low, trembling voice, \u0026ldquo;Let us get to the shore and then I\u0026rsquo;ll tell you my history and you\u0026rsquo;ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.\u0026rdquo;\nIt was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it; there were a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice led the way and the whole party swam to the shore.\n","permalink":"https://dmyates.github.io/hugo-all-over-theme/1862/07/05/ch2-the-pool-of-tears/","tags":["mice","white rabbit","alice","curiouser"],"title":"Chapter II: The Pool of Tears"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do. Once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, \u0026ldquo;and what is the use of a book,\u0026rdquo; thought Alice, \u0026ldquo;without pictures or conversations?\u0026rdquo;\nSo she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.\nThere was nothing so very remarkable in that, nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, \u0026ldquo;Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!\u0026rdquo; But when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket and looked at it and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and, burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it and was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole, under the hedge. In another moment, down went Alice after it!\nThe rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down what seemed to be a very deep well.\nEither the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time, as she went down, to look about her. First, she tried to make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed. It was labeled \u0026ldquo;ORANGE MARMALADE,\u0026rdquo; but, to her great disappointment, it was empty; she did not like to drop the jar, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.\nDown, down, down! Would the fall never come to an end? There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking to herself. \u0026ldquo;Dinah\u0026rsquo;ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!\u0026rdquo; (Dinah was the cat.) \u0026ldquo;I hope they\u0026rsquo;ll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah, my dear, I wish you were down here with me!\u0026rdquo; Alice felt that she was dozing off, when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.\nAlice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up in a moment. She looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost. Away went Alice like the wind and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, \u0026ldquo;Oh, my ears and whiskers, how late it\u0026rsquo;s getting!\u0026rdquo; She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen.\nShe found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof. There were doors all \u0026lsquo;round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.\nSuddenly she came upon a little table, all made of solid glass. There was nothing on it but a tiny golden key, and Alice\u0026rsquo;s first idea was that this might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but, at any rate, it would not open any of them. However, on the second time \u0026lsquo;round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high. She tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight, it fitted!\nAlice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole; she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the doorway. \u0026ldquo;Oh,\u0026rdquo; said Alice, \u0026ldquo;how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.\u0026rdquo;\nAlice went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate, a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes. This time she found a little bottle on it (\u0026ldquo;which certainly was not here before,\u0026rdquo; said Alice), and tied \u0026lsquo;round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words \u0026ldquo;DRINK ME\u0026rdquo; beautifully printed on it in large letters.\n\u0026ldquo;No, I\u0026rsquo;ll look first,\u0026rdquo; she said, \u0026ldquo;and see whether it\u0026rsquo;s marked \u0026lsquo;poison\u0026rsquo; or not,\u0026rdquo; for she had never forgotten that, if you drink from a bottle marked \u0026ldquo;poison,\u0026rdquo; it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later. However, this bottle was not marked \u0026ldquo;poison,\u0026rdquo; so Alice ventured to taste it, and, finding it very nice (it had a sort of mixed flavor of cherry-tart, custard, pineapple, roast turkey, toffy and hot buttered toast), she very soon finished it off.\n\u0026ldquo;What a curious feeling!\u0026rdquo; said Alice. \u0026ldquo;I must be shutting up like a telescope!\u0026rdquo;\nAnd so it was indeed! She was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden.\nAfter awhile, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! When she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery, and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.\n\u0026ldquo;Come, there\u0026rsquo;s no use in crying like that!\u0026rdquo; said Alice to herself rather sharply. \u0026ldquo;I advise you to leave off this minute!\u0026rdquo; She generally gave herself very good advice (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes.\nSoon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it and found in it a very small cake, on which the words \u0026ldquo;EAT ME\u0026rdquo; were beautifully marked in currants. \u0026ldquo;Well, I\u0026rsquo;ll eat it,\u0026rdquo; said Alice, \u0026ldquo;and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door: so either way I\u0026rsquo;ll get into the garden, and I don\u0026rsquo;t care which happens!\u0026rdquo;\nShe ate a little bit and said anxiously to herself, \u0026ldquo;Which way? Which way?\u0026rdquo; holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way she was growing; and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size. So she set to work and very soon finished off the cake.\n","permalink":"https://dmyates.github.io/hugo-all-over-theme/1862/07/04/ch1-down-the-rabbit-hole/","tags":["down down down","white rabbit","alice","drink me","eat me"],"title":"Chapter I: Down the Rabbit-Hole"},{"categories":null,"contents":"No content here will be rendered.\n","permalink":"https://dmyates.github.io/hugo-all-over-theme/search/","tags":null,"title":"Search Results"}]
